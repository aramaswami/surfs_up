# Climate Analysis  

An investor has requested an analysis of precipitation and temperature data for the months of June and December as part of his due diligence. I have analyzed the measurement data and summarized my observations and areas for further analysis. The second half of the climate_analysis notebook contains the code related to this challenge.

### Part_1: Identify key statistical data in June across all of the stations and years using the describe() function.  

I created dataframes and extracted precipitation and temperature data for June, across all years for which data is available. The describe() table is included here for reference:

### Part_2: Identify key statistical data in December across all stations and years using the describe() function.  
As for Part_1, I created dataframes and extracted precipitation and temperature data for June, across all years for which data is available. The describe() table is included here for reference:

### Part_3: Analysis  

The data for June shows that precipitation averages around 0.024 with a max recorded level of 0.89. In December, the averages for precipitation was 0.11 and a max of 4.94. Temperatures averages around 74.9 in June and 71 in December.  

Clearly June is a more temperate month but December is also warm on average, which suggests that demand may be at a good level throughout the year.  

Recommendations for further analysis:  

Related to weather, we looked at a couple of variables. It would be helpful to understand other weather patterns (such as high winds and other conditions) that may impact demand. While weather data is a reliable indicator, it may be good to also study local business reference points. This includes seasonal tourism, events, and other factors that may draw visitors.
